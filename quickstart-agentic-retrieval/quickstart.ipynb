Some of Earth\\u0027s most spectacular light shows are natural, like the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, in the Northern Hemisphere (aurora australis, or Southern Lights, in the Southern Hemisphere). The auroras are natural electrical phenomena caused by charged particles that race from the Sun toward Earth, inducing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere and creating the appearance of streamers of reddish or greenish light in the sky, usually near the northern or southern magnetic pole. Other natural lights can indicate danger, like a raging forest fire encroaching on a city, town, or community, or lava spewing from an erupting volcano.\\n\\nWhatever the source, the ability of humans to monitor nature\\u0027s light shows at night has practical applications for society. For example, tracking fires during nighttime hours allows for continuous monitoring and enhances our ability to protect humans and other animals, plants, and infrastructure. Combined with other data sources, our ability to observe the light of fires at night allows emergency managers to more efficiently and accurately issue warnings and evacuation orders and allows firefighting efforts to continue through the night. With enough moonlight (e.g., full-Moon phase), it\\u0027s even possible to track the movement of smoke plumes at night, which can impact air quality, regardless of time of day.\\n\\nAnother natural source of light at night is emitted from glowing lava flows at the site of active volcanoes. Again, with enough moonlight, these dramatic scenes can be tracked and monitored for both scientific research and public safety.\\n\\n\\n### Figure: The Northern Lights Viewed from Space\\n\\n**September 17, 2011**\\n\\nThis photo, taken from the International Space Station on September 17, 2011, shows a spectacular display of the aurora borealis (Northern Lights) as green and reddish light in the night sky above Earth. In the foreground, part of a Soyuz spacecraft is visible, silhouetted against the bright auroral light. The green glow is generated by energetic charged particles from the Sun interacting with Earth\\u0027s upper atmosphere, exciting oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and producing characteristic colors. The image demonstrates the vividness and grandeur of natural night-time light phenomena as seen from orbit.\",\n",

      "    \"page_chunk\": \"For the first time in perhaps a decade, Mount Etna experienced a \\u0022flank eruption\\u0022\\u2014erupting from its side instead of its summit\\u2014on December 24, 2018. The activity was accompanied by 130 earthquakes occurring over three hours that morning. Mount Etna, Europe\\u2019s most active volcano, has seen periodic activity on this part of the mountain since 2013. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite acquired the main image of Mount Etna on December 28, 2018.\\n\\nThe inset image highlights the active vent and thermal infrared signature from lava flows, which can be seen near the newly formed fissure on the southeastern side of the volcano. The inset was created with data from OLI and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on Landsat 8. Ash spewing from the fissure cloaked adjacent villages and delayed aircraft from landing at the nearby Catania airport. Earthquakes occurred in the subsequent days after the initial eruption and displaced hundreds of people from their homes.\\n\\nFor nighttime images of Mount Etna\\u2019s March 2017 eruption, see pages 48\\u201351.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Hazards of Volcanic Ash Plumes and Satellite Observation\\n\\nWith the help of moonlight, satellite instruments can track volcanic ash plumes, which present significant hazards to airplanes in flight. The volcanic ash\\u2014composed of tiny pieces of glass and rock\\u2014is abrasive to engine turbine blades, and can melt on the blades and other engine parts, causing damage and even engine stalls. This poses a danger to both the plane\\u2019s integrity and passenger safety. Volcanic ash also reduces visibility for pilots and can cause etching of windshields, further reducing pilots\\u2019 ability to see. Nightlight images can be combined with thermal images to provide a more complete view of volcanic activity on Earth\\u2019s surface.\\n\\nThe VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) on polar-orbiting satellites uses faint light sources such as moonlight, airglow (the atmosphere\\u2019s self-illumination through chemical reactions), zodiacal light (sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust), and starlight from the Milky Way. Using these dim light sources, the DNB can detect changes in clouds, snow cover, and sea ice:\\n\\n#### Table: Light Sources Used by VIIRS DNB\\n\\n| Light Source         | Description                                                                  |\\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Moonlight            | Reflected sunlight from the Moon, illuminating Earth\\u0027s surface at night      |\\n| Airglow              | Atmospheric self-illumination from chemical reactions                        |\\n| Zodiacal Light       | Sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust                                    |\\n| Starlight/Milky Way  | Faint illumination provided by stars in the Milky Way                        |\\n\\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), managed by NOAA, orbit over Earth\\u2019s equator and offer uninterrupted observations of North America. High-latitude areas such as Alaska benefit from polar-orbiting satellites like Suomi NPP, which provide overlapping coverage at the poles, enabling more data collection in these regions. During polar darkness (winter months), VIIRS DNB data allow scientists to:\\n\\n- Observe sea ice formation\\n- Monitor snow cover extent at the highest latitudes\\n- Detect open water for ship navigation\\n\\n#### Table: Satellite Coverage Overview\\n\\n| Satellite Type          | Orbit           | Coverage Area         | Special Utility                              |\\n|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|\\n| GOES                   | Geostationary   | Equatorial/North America | Continuous regional monitoring              |\\n| Polar-Orbiting (e.g., Suomi NPP) | Polar-orbiting    | Poles/high latitudes      | Overlapping passes; useful during polar night|\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weather Forecasting and Nightlight Data\\n\\nThe use of nightlight data by weather forecasters is growing as the VIIRS instrument enables observation of clouds at night illuminated by sources such as moonlight and lightning. Scientists use these data to study the nighttime behavior of weather systems, including severe storms, which can develop and strike populous areas at night as well as during the day. Combined with thermal data, visible nightlight data allow the detection of clouds at various heights in the atmosphere, such as dense marine fog. This capability enables weather forecasters to issue marine advisories with higher confidence, leading to greater utility.

A key instrument on Suomi NPP is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which is a multispectral instrument that scans 1889-mile- (3040-kilometer-) wide swaths of data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Figure 1. VIIRS instrument active scanning swath\\n\\nThis figure shows a global view of the Earth at night, with the VIIRS satellite positioned above the surface. The satellite is scanning a wide nighttime swath over North and South America, as depicted by a highlighted, rectangular region that stretches from near the North Pole to the South Pole, crossing over the United States and South America. The highlighted region represents the area being scanned by the VIIRS instrument, clearly showing the satellite\\u2019s orbital track and the data collection sweep across the globe. The visible areas include illuminated urban regions\\u2014clusters of light in the eastern United States and portions of South America\\u2014demonstrating the sensitivity of the instrument to city lights at night.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Figure 2. Nighttime swath\\n\\nThis figure presents a global map projection with a highlighted \\u0022nighttime swath\\u0022 running north to south over the Americas and the Atlantic Ocean, as indicated by a white label and arrow. The background is a composite satellite image showing Earth\\u0027s continents and cloud cover, with much of the image in daylight and a defined nighttime swath stretching vertically from North America through South America. Within the swath, city lights are visible, especially over the central and eastern United States and parts of South America, illustrating the data captured by VIIRS during nighttime hours. The figure contextualizes the satellite\\u0027s path and the daily coverage achieved by its Earth-at-night observations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Suomi NPP satellite observes Earth\\u0027s surface throughout the day and at night. The Day/Night Band (DNB) of the VIIRS instrument detects light in a range of wavelengths from green (500 nanometers) to near-infrared (900 nanometers) and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as city lights\\u2014down to the scale of an isolated highway lamp\\u2014wildfires, gas flares, auroras, and reflected moonlight at night. In this example (above), the satellite acquired a swath of data during nighttime hours over portions of South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Eastern United States.\",\n",
