# C# quickstart for Azure AI Search

![Flask sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This quickstart is focused on the fundamentals: creating, loading, and querying a search index. 

New and legacy versions are provided so that you can learn these operations with the client libraries used in your solution. Both versions create a search index that is modeled on a subset of the built-in Hotels dataset, reduced in this quickstart for readability and comprehension. Index definition and documents are included in the code. When you run the program, a console window emits output messages for each step: deleting and then re-creating a hotels-quickstart index, loading documents, running queries.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Azure AI Search service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
- [Azure.Search.Documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search.documents-readme) and the Azure SDK for .NEt
